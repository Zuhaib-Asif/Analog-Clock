# Analog-Clock

This project is a simple analog clock that displays the current time in a visually appealing and easy-to-read format.

Installation: To use this clock, simply clone or download the repository and open the index.html file in a web browser.

Usage: The analog clock automatically displays the current time based on your computer's clock. The clock's hands move in real-time, providing an accurate and up-to-date representation of the time.

Project Structure: The project includes a single HTML file (index.html), a CSS file (style.css), and a JavaScript file (script.js). The HTML file is responsible for providing the structure of the clock interface, while the CSS file handles the styling and responsiveness using media queries. Finally, the JavaScript file is responsible for the clock's timekeeping and hand movement logic.
